# Fuzzy-Matching-and-GIS
This is still in early stages of development. This repo hosts a Python Shiny application designed to enable the user to: use fuzzy logic to see the most relevant matching pairs between two datasets, while also using coordinate points to further determine whether the matching pairs represent the same location.
