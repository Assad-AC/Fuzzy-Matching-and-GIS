# Fuzzy-Matching-and-GIS
This is still in early stages of development. This repo hosts a Python Shiny application designed to enable the user to: use fuzzy logic to see the most relevant matching pairs between two datasets, while also using coordinate points to further determine whether the matching pairs represent the same location. This is useful for anyone who needs to pair data with strings which are inexact, especially to develop master lists across heterogeneous datasets.
